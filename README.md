## Overview

This repository provides the official implementation of our Geographic Domain Adaptation (GDA) method introduced in the paper:

**"Learning Region-specific Features and Matching Distributions Across Regions in Geographic Domain Adaptation"**

Our method explicitly addresses geographic domain adaptation by modeling and adapting to regional variations such as architectural styles, backgrounds, and context-specific object appearances. The method significantly improves model accuracy across geographic domains, such as USA â†” Asia transfers.

### Highlights:

- **Region-specific feature learning**: Captures and leverages region-specific visual characteristics.
- **Cross-region distribution matching**: Aligns domain distributions selectively, preserving discriminative information.
- **Superclass-level adaptation**: Utilizes semantic class hierarchies to enhance adaptation performance.
